[Kaos Klub](https://opensea.io/collection/kaos-klub) is a collection of 70 [mathematical constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant) as NFTs. In each case, 1420 digits are calculated and drawn to show the chaos these numbers possess, artistically. 

## Explaining w/ Example

![banner-img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107322691/210547946-0e8bc417-04a8-46af-a9af-ab81d8156edb.gif)

In this example we've got `x.041530341530415`.

Starting at the first digit right after the decimal point we've got 0 which means we have to go upwards, as shown at the left-hand side of the gif above. 

The color is yellow because we're at the very first digit. As we approach the last digits the color of the lines will change from yellow to green as shown at the bottom of the gif.

For this example we end at 5 which is a downwards line. 

The beginnings and endings have a circle so that you can walk through the lines.

The same goes for all NFTs: for $\pi$ we have `3.14159...` which means you start at 1, going north-east, and then south-east for 4, and so on.

## Irrationality

All these constants are irrational, which means none of the digits repeat with a pattern, hence acting chaotic.
